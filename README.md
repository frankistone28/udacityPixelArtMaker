## Why this project?

This project was created as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree about the topic: DOM manipulation.

It is a single-page web application that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

## How to run the app?

Open the live app at <https://frankistone28.github.io/udacityPixelArtMaker/>

1) In the top part, set the size of the canvas
2) Choose a color
3) Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

For now it works just as simple as that but in the coming days as I learn more of javascript and jquery I will be adding new features like ...

1) Click and Drag Painting
2) Eraser Tool
3) Multiple Brush Sizes
4) Eyedropper Tool
5) Toggle Grid
6) Clear Canvas
7) Choose Canvas Background Color and many more ...

## Instructions For Project

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.
